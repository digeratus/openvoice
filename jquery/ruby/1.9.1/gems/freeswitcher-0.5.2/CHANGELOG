[575455a | 2009-02-20 17:27:32 UTC] bougyman <bougyman@hellspass.nationwide-recovery.com>

  * Refactored FSR::Listener::Outbound, now a module instead of a class

     * Removed '.' from LOAD_PATH in FSR::App
     * Added specs for FSR::App:Bridge
     * Added FSR::Listener::Outbound::Session and ::CommandReply to
       differentiate the data that is received on a socket
     * Modules which include FSR::Listener::Outbound now need to handle
       session_initiated(FSR::Listener::Outbound::Session.new) and
       command_reply(FSR::Listener::Outbound::CommandReply.new)

  * Added class level commands to profile and more argument type handling

     * Profile.start(profile_name) will start a profile. stop, rescan, and
       stop also act in this manner
     * Sofia.new.profile(arguments) still works with a string, but now
       also accepts an options hash {:action => :start, :name => "foo"}

     * Fifo << "myqueue" shortcut for Fifo.new("myqueue", "in")
     * Fifo >> "myqueue" shortcut for Fifo.new("myqueue", "out", :wait => false)

  * Removed fs_socket requirement from commands, refactored Cmd::Originate

     * FSR::Cmd::Command classes should not require the first argument
       (fs_socket).  Allowing it to be nil enables testing without a fs
       server
     * Merged @originator and @application into @endpoint in Cmd::Originate,
       a typecheck determines whether endpoint is an App and runs #raw, or
       a string and just sends the string
